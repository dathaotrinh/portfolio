            My name is Thao Trinh, pronouces Tow Trin.

            I thrive on challenges and would love to overcome hardship in software development industry. I love to work
            in
            a company in which helps me expand my knowledge related to Computer Science field as well as build more
            interesting projects. In exchange, I will devote my time and efforts to make the projects stand out.

            On a more personal note, I enjoy watching videos about new gadgets, mukbang. I also love singing (but
            honestly, my voice is terrible).
